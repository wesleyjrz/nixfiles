No more [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), git bare repositories nor [yadm](https://yadm.io/). Now I'm a
true NixOS gigachad :sunglasses:.

## About

It has been a long time since I switched from Arch Linux to the superior NixOS,
this repository is the result of more than a year of work and research. It won't
have a long commit history from 2023 because I thought it might be risky to
maybe publish some private information accidentaly.
